# LPO-XAF
## Landrys Project Organizer - Implemented with DevExpress XAF Framework

### Objective
The intent of this program is to serve as a multi-project, multi-client project organization tool.


### To Do List
- Debug the following error, which occurs when 'Project Events' is clicked from the Projects navigation folder: *'Cannot load invalid type 'lpmt_xaf.Module.BusinessObjects.Project_Schedule.ProjectEvent'.'*
- Add the ability to create/edit **labels** for the scheduling events.  By default, the program should offer labels for different disciplines. This way when a new event is added to the calendar, it can be labeled and colored to its associated discipline.
